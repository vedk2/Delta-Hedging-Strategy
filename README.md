![Project Banner](images/banner.png)

## Overview
This project demonstrates an advanced delta hedging strategy for options trading. The strategy aims to reduce the risk associated with price movements of the underlying stock by dynamically adjusting the position in options. It leverages data analysis and predictive modeling to forecast the future portfolio value and optimize the hedging process.

## Project Description
Delta hedging is a popular options trading strategy that helps minimize the directional risk of an investment. This project implements a dynamic delta hedging strategy that automatically adjusts the hedged position based on changes in the delta of the options portfolio. The strategy is applied to historical stock data and can be used to predict future portfolio performance.

The project uses Python, `yfinance` for data retrieval, and various analytical libraries such as `pandas` and `numpy`. It also includes extensive data visualization with `matplotlib` to gain insights into the performance of the strategy over time.

## Features
- **Automated Data Retrieval**: Fetches historical stock and options data using `yfinance`.
- **Delta Hedging Strategy**: Dynamically adjusts the position to maintain a delta-neutral portfolio.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Predicts future portfolio values using statistical models.
- **Comprehensive Visualizations**: Plots of portfolio value, implied volatility, and options prices over time.
- **User Flexibility**: The strategy can be applied to any stock and expiration date by adjusting input parameters.
